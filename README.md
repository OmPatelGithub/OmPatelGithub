- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OmPatelGithub
I am a first year computer science student at the University of Toronto
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Artificial Intelligence and using data analysis techniques to increase effectiveness in other fields like finance.
In fact, I am currently developing a Trading view indicator that displays institutional transactions on equities. I couldn't find any indicator that 
did exactly what I wanted, so I made one!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on the yahoo finance parcer that will be used for the indicator
