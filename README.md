- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OmPatelGithub
I am a second year computer science student at the University of Toronto
- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m interested in Artificial Intelligence and using data analysis techniques to increase effectiveness in other fields like finance.
In fact, I am currently developing a Trading view indicator that displays the relative strength/weakness of any stock respective to the SPY. I couldn't find any indicator that did exactly what I wanted, so I made one!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently also working on other projects such as an autonomous aircraft!
